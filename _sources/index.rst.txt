Welcome to ``pyoti`` documentation!
=====================================

The pyoti library is a Python library to support the Order Truncated Imaginary (OTI) algebra [ref to thesis]. The OTI numbers can be used to compute derivatives of Python functions with respect to multiple input parameters in a fast and efficient manner.

In order to use OTI

OTI numbers extend the dual numbers to multiple imaginary basis.
