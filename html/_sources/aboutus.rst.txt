The OTI numbers, and its corresponding computational implementation, were initially developed by Mauricio Aristizabal during his Ph.D. studies as he was exploring using hypercomplex algebras to compute high-order shape derivatives in Finite Element analyses for optimization appliations. Although hypercomplex algebras like Hyperdual numbers and Multicomplex numbers were options for obtaining high-order derivatives, its exponential growth in size prevents its deployment in multivariate analysis. Therefore, the focus has always been to provide linear-algebra focused applications, like the inite Elemetn analsis method , with a robust an efficient implementation of an algebra that allows fast computations of arbitrary order multivariable derivatives.
