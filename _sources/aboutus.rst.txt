About
=====

The OTI numbers, and its corresponding computational implementation, were initially developed by Dr. Mauricio Aristizabal during his Ph.D. studies as he was researching the use of hypercomplex algebras and other automatic differentiation approaches to compute high-order shape derivatives in Finite Element analyses for optimization appliations. Although hypercomplex algebras like Hyperdual numbers and Multicomplex numbers were options for obtaining high-order derivatives, its exponential growth in size prevents its deployment high performance multivariate analysis. 

The focus has always been to provide support for linear-algebra applications, like the Finite Element analses, with a robust an efficient implementation of an algebra that allows arbitrary order multivariable derivatives.

The development of the library (otilib and pyoti), began in 2016 and has been actively developed by Dr. Aristizabal since then. In 2024, Samuel Roberts (PhD Student, UTSA) started contributing to the development of the library, specially improving performance of the static-dense implementation of the library.
