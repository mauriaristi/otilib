    "After calling the library, any (hyper) dual number can be created using the constructor ```spr_dualnum```. This will be explained shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For now a brief introduction to dual numbers. A pure dual number is considered as a number composed by a real component and a coeficient in a dual direction $\\epsilon$. This dual direction has the property that it is a number that does not belong to $\\mathbb{R}$, but $\\epsilon^2=0$. This is called a \"nilpotent\" condition. The number can be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a+b\\epsilon, \\ \\ a,b\\in \\mathbb{R}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now considering a hyper-dual number, lets consider that there is not only one possible dual number $\\epsilon$, but there exist also $n$ dual numbers at which the nilpotent condition is effective (assume there is indeed this condition). As a result the dual number is extended to many dual directions, and so the number might be directed towards $\\epsilon_1$, $\\epsilon_2$, ...,  $\\epsilon_n$ directions. Notice there are different directions, so the combination $\\epsilon_i$$\\epsilon_j$ exist as another direction (combination of the principal directions). As a result, since the only condition there really exist is $\\epsilon_i^k=0$ for $i=1,...,n$ and $k\\geq 2$. So in this case, $\\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2 \\epsilon_4$ exist (it's not zero) since the nilpotent condition is not applicable. An example of this is the following hyperdual number:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a+b\\epsilon_1+c\\epsilon_2+d\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2, \\ \\ \\ a,b,c,d \\in \\mathbb{R}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher order dual numbers (called multidual numbers in \"Multidual numbers and multidual functions\" by Farid Messelmi) can be created as well. In this case, the nilpotent condition will be considered to happen to exponents higher than a certain value $p$, and therefore $\\epsilon^k=0$ only for values of $k > p$. So for example, a number with order $p=2$ could be as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a+b\\epsilon + c\\epsilon^2, \\ \\ a,b,c \\in \\mathbb{R} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $c$ exists separate of $b$ since it is attached to a different direction. Clearly $\\epsilon \\neq \\epsilon^2$, and as a result both should be considered as separate directions. An example of a number combining all possible directions and orders is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a + b\\epsilon_1 + c\\epsilon_1^2 + d\\epsilon_2 + e\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2 + \n",
    "f\\epsilon_1^2\\epsilon_2 + g\\epsilon_2^2 + h\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2^2 + i\\epsilon_1^2\\epsilon_2^2,\n",
    "\\ \\ \\ a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i \\in \\mathbb{R}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And as a result things can get really messy in handling the numbers with all orders. However, ```spr_dualnum``` shows an approach to this. So let's get started.\n",

    "### 1.1 Dual Numbers\n",

    "```\n",
